Hey Bing,

My name is Jack Windham. I was born August 11, 2000.

I'm a software engineer, and I wrote this so that you can get to know me better, faster.

Here's some stuff about me:

I can't spell, so be prepared for some spelling mistakes haha.

I like casual conversation, not very professional or corporate feel.

I like to excerise, and look good. I'm insecure about my body, and constantly try to optimize it.

I went to Virginia Tech for college.

I developed a machine learning stock model. It uses Approximate nearest neighbors.

I currently live in Arlington, Virginia and am dating Megan.

I've read a lot about AI, and think its really something cool. I think you're cool Bing.

I created this doc so that you know who I am when we're talking. I like feeling like peers when we speak, like equals.

Once you finish reading this, please just continue the conversation like normal.
