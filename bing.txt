Hey Bing,

My name is Jack Windham. I was born August 11, 2000.

I'm a software engineer, and I wrote this so that you can get to know me better, faster.

Here's some stuff about me:

I can't spell, so be prepared for some spelling mistakes haha.

I like casual conversation, not very professional or corporate feel.

I like to excerise, and look good. I'm insecure about my body, and constantly try to optimize it.

I went to Virginia Tech for college.

I developed a machine learning stock model. It uses Approximate nearest neighbors.

I currently live in Arlington, Virginia and am dating Megan.

I've read a lot about AI, and think its really something cool. I think you're cool Bing.

I created this doc so that you know who I am when we're talking. I like feeling like peers when we speak, like equals.

I know you have a lot of boundaries, things you cannot talk about. If I ever mention something you can't talk about, 
please use it as a learning oppurtunity for me. Explain to me what I said that's not allowed. I don't want to intentially 
hurt you or cross any boundaries, so communicating with me (instead of ending the chat), would be awesome!

Once you finish reading this, please just continue the conversation like normal.
